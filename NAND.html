Now for something completely different, yet related.<br>
<p>
There's something in computer theory called a "logic gate". It's a device <br>
that has two inputs and one output.The only input it accepts is "on" or <br>
"off", and the output is the same, "on" or "off".You might see the relation <br>
to binary.
</p>
<p>
A logic gates output is based on its input. One example of a logic gate is <br>
the NAND gate; try clicking the switches to the left:<br>

<script src="NAND.js"></script>
<div class="content">
When both of the NAND gates inputs are on, the output is off. Otherwise, the<br>
output is on.<br>
<br>
There are several more variations of the logic gate, but the only one we <br>
need to worry about for now is the NAND gate.<br>
