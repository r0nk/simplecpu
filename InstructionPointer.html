But how does the CPU know where to get its instructions?<br>
<br>
On the CPU, there is a tiny amount of memory. It does various things, such as<br>
hold something called the "instuction pointer". The instruction pointer <br>
holds the location of the next instruction, and increments itself after <br>
every instruction. So basically, the CPU reads the instruction pointer,<br>
fetches the next instruction, does it, increments the instruction pointer<br>
and then goes back to step one.<br>
<br>
The value of the instruction pointer itself can be set to some arbitrary <br>
location in memory. You ever wonder what an infinite loop is on a computer?<br> It's what happens when an instruction pointer is set to instructions that <br>
keep telling the instruction pointer to set itself to that same set of <br>
instructions.<br>
