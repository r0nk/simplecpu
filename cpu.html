			To modify memory, simply click on the bits while the cpu is off. You can<br>
			scroll through memory as well. To allow the cpu to start executing <br>
			instructions, turn the switch on.<br>
			<br>
			This cpu has three different instructions:<br>
			<table>
			 <tr>
			  <td><b>Instruction</b></td>
			  <td></td>
			  <td><b>Code</b></td>
			 <tr>
			  <td><i>add the value at the address held at (Instruction Pointer + 1)<br>
			 to the value at the address held at (Instruction Pointer + 2)</i></td>
			  <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			  <td>00000001</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			  <td><i>subtract the value at the address held at (Instruction Pointer + 2)<br>
			 from the value at the address held at (Instruction Pointer + 1)</i></td>
			  <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			  <td>00000010</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			  <td><i>move the value at the address held at (Instruction Pointer + 1)<br>
			 to the value at the address held at (Instruction Pointer + 2)</i></td>
			  <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			  <td>00000011</td>
			 </tr>
			</table>
			<br>
			All of the instructions have a size of 3 bytes (operands included).This <br>
			means that we increment the instruction pointer by 3 after each instruction <br>
			is executed.<br>
			<br>
			The instruction pointer can be accessed by addressing memory location 00000000.
